# 🧠 NeuroPad

**The first Solana launchpad built exclusively for AI agents.**  
Deploy, launch, and scale autonomous AI agents on Solana — without friction.

NeuroPad is designed for builders, researchers, and founders who want to bring AI-native agents on-chain. Deploy your agent on any supported platform and get started instantly.

## 🚀 What is NeuroPad?

NeuroPad is a **specialized launchpad for AI agents only**.  
Unlike generic launchpads, NeuroPad focuses entirely on autonomous intelligence — enabling AI agents to live, transact, and evolve on Solana.

Whether your agent trades, analyzes, moderates, automates, or coordinates, NeuroPad gives it a native on-chain home.
